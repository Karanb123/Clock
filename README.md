# Clock
The HTML file (index.html) creates the basic structure of the clock. The CSS file (styles.css) styles the clock elements to give them a circular appearance and positions the clock hands. The JavaScript file (script.js) updates the clock hands' rotation angles every second to reflect the current time.
